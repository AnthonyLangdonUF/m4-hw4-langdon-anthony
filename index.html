    <h2>About Anderson .Paak</h2>
  </header>
    <p>Brandon Paak Anderson, better known as Anderson .Paak, is a rapper, singer and drummer from Oxnard, California. He's known for his solo work, being the frontman of the Free Nationals band, and his duo projects NxWorries and Silk Sonic, alongside Knxwledge and Bruno Mars, respectively.</p></section>

    <h3>An adverse beginning</h3>
      <p>A lengthy profile from ESPN reporter and .Paak's old neighbor Dwayne Bray paints a stark shift in the Black and Korean-American musician's youth - from rich in love with material wealth to boot, to a home broken by his father's drug addiction, attempted murder of .Paak's mother, and his mother's long-term jail sentence for business fraud.</p>
      <p>Through it all, .Paak buried his head in music. Starting as the drummer at his family's church, he eventually starting producing his own music and rapping on songs. Two marriages, one son and a stint of homelessness later, 'Breezy Lovejoy,' as he was once known, took his current moniker and worked odd jobs in the Los Angeles music scene until releasing his debut album <em>Venice</em> in 2014. A year later, he featured on a whopping six tracks of Dr. Dre's album, <em>Compton.</em></section>

    <h3>More solo albums</h3>
      <p>.Paak expanded on his R&B, soul and rap influences with his second full-length project, <em>Malibu.</em> Released in early 2016, the record featured guest producers such as Madlib, 9th Wonder and Kaytranada, and verses from The Game, Rapsody, ScHoolboy Q and Talib Kweli.</p>
      <p>The exposure from <em>Compton</em> paved the way for a warm welcome from critics, and the album solidifed .Paak's status as a multi-hyphenate artist, writing lyrics, playing drums on tracks and even producing much of the album himself on a Macbook.</p>
      <p>Between 2018 and early 2019, Anderson .Paak released not one, but two albums in a span of six months, <em>Oxnard,</em> and <em>Ventura.</em> The latter was thought to be a bonus album of cutting-room-floor fluff, but ended up being the free-flowing critical darling compared to the former, which according to some was hamstrung by Dr. Dre's authority over the production. Notably, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, Smokey Robinson, Andre 3000 and, posthumously, Nate Dogg, filled out many of the features across these two.</p></section>

      <h3>Silk Sonic</h3>
        <p>.Paak and pop superstar Bruno Mars have worked together since at least 2017, when .Paak opened for Mars on the Europe leg of his 24K Magic Tour. The idea of forming an R&B superduo began then, but purely as a joke, a parody of the luscious, velvet-soaked sex tunes of yesteryear. That is, until 2021, when they released "Leave the Door Open," their debut single. It has over 700 million views on YouTube in less than three years.</p></section></article>

    <p>The Free Nationals are Anderson .Paak's backing band. Ron "T.Nava" Avant plays the keys, vocoder and backup vocals; Kelsey Gonzales plays bass; Jose Rios plays lead guitar; and Callum Connor plays drums and percussion. .Paak is the lead vocalist and splits drumming responsibilities with Connor. Their NPR Tiny Desk Concert, with .Paak on drums, is one of the most successful in the long-running series' history, with over 100 million views.</p></aside>
